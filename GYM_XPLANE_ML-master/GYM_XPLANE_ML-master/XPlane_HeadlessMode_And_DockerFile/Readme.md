##### Headless Plane Mode
-----------------------

In this section, the aim is to document how to run:
  * X-Plane in a Headless mode (Without the Xserver or the graphics interface). This will enable deploying xplane on servers without dedicated user interface (for example on  Amazon cloud -- bearing in mind each version deployed must have its own licence).
  * It is also preferable to run with XServer or the graphics interface for the first time to ensure everything is working as intended. Then one could switch to headless mode in other to deploy on large scale. Headless mode will save a lot in computation cost and time.
  * Investigate Docker set up for running xplane
